The elm guide has a time example (showing a clock drawn using svg). 
It suggests an exercise of adding a checkbox for pausing the clock.
This requires adding a paused boolean to the model, using it to alter the subscription to time ticks,
and showing a checkbox in the output (combining html with svg there).
This is my code which does that exercise (by modifying the example code in the elm guide).

It's mainly here to show how to draw svg, and what imports and packages are needed for that.
