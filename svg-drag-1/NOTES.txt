NOTES.txt

needed to compile, when in a fresh directory:
% elm-package install elm-lang/mouse
% elm-package install elm-lang/svg
% elm-make *.elm

to remake index.html, just run % elm-make *.elm [assuming *.elm matches only this file]

this is modified from the prior example html-drag-2, in several ways:

+ use svg instead of html

possible future mods: ###
- add mouse hover properties
- drag by setting svg transform attribute
- use optims of virtual-dom diff speed (keyed, lazy)
- more ###

- ultimately it should grow into some kind of mouse-controlled "drawing program".
