NOTES.txt

needed to compile, when in a fresh directory:
make sure the installed Elm version is the one desired (by installing it from Elm guide doc); then:

% elm-package install elm-lang/mouse
% elm-package install elm-lang/svg
% elm-make *.elm

to remake index.html, just run % elm-make *.elm [assuming *.elm matches only the main source file]

to remove everything generated by the above:
% rm -rf elm-stuff
% rm index.html elm-package.json


original Elm example this came from: http://elm-lang.org/examples/drag

this is modified from the prior example html-drag-2, in several ways:

+ use svg instead of html

possible future mods: ###
- add mouse hover properties
- drag by setting svg transform attribute
- use optims of virtual-dom diff speed (keyed, lazy)
 - perhaps checkbox-enabled, for testing their effect
- more ###

- ultimately it should grow into some kind of mouse-controlled "drawing program".
  - with different drag behaviors on different objects, eg dividers

TODO:
- copy to new example folder for adding fancier things (like the ones described above)

-- ISSUES FOR UPGRADING ELM VERSION TO 0.18:
-- + a local variable view' will need to be renamed.
-- + the use of Svg.text' will need revision to work with however that was renamed in the Svg module.
--   + it was renamed to Svg.text_, according to http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/svg/2.0.0/Svg
-- Maybe the automatic upgrader will fix these itself? I could try it, except it might reformat in ways I won't like.
-- + So for now I am just doing those changes manually.
-- Discovered by experiment or by looking at http://elm-lang.org/examples/drag current state (maybe in upgrade doc too?):
-- + remove Html.App, just get program from Html not from App
