[soon will have modifications by bruce (github user oresmus), perhaps commented as such]

==

to compile:

    % elm-make Mario.elm

bugs:

    this readme file might not be in real markdown syntax

    animation is visibly non-smooth (though not too terrible; in mac safari)

    missing instructions (by experiment and code review, arrow keys are the only input)

    missing mario images (runs, but browser displays a missing-image icon)

    trivial game -- no "platforms", no side-scrolling, etc

features:

    does look like a decent architecture for Elm 0.17, and a correct use of animationFrame
