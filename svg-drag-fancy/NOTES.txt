NOTES.txt

For general notes (eg make/upgrade issues) see ../svg-drag-1/NOTES.txt.

original Elm example this came from: http://elm-lang.org/examples/drag

The plan is to gradually add more features to this same example -- 
no attempt to "keep it simple", unlike all prior examples.

possible mods, relative to the prior example svg-drag-1:
- add mouse hover properties
- drag by setting svg transform attribute
- use optims of virtual-dom diff speed (keyed, lazy)
 - perhaps checkbox-enabled, for testing their effect
- add more kinds of objects, some with different drag behaviors (eg dividers)
- ultimately it should grow into some kind of mouse-controlled "drawing program".
